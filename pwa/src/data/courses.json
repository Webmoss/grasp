        "Yuga Labs launches 1st season of Web3 crafting game, the HV-MTL Forge.",
      "description":
        "HV-MTL Forge is a game that starts as a casual world builder and pet game and ends as a competitive dungeon crawler. Originally summoned as mysterious little cubes called Power Sources, the HVs of the HV-MTL collection are now in their Evo1 state. Your HV is relying on you to earn up to 6 powerful upgrades for its Evo2 form.At least 3 of these powerful upgrades known as AMPs will be needed for your HV to reach its Evo2 state, and any HV that participates in a season (regardless of rank) will earn an AMP.Daily voting by other HV holders will determine your seasonal leaderboard ranking. The seasonal ranking will ultimately decide the rarity of the AMP you earn. HV-MTL Forge will last for 6 seasons giving players 6 chances at upgrades.Once the 3rd season comes to a close, HVâ€™s with the required energy will be able to enter The Rift.Before you ape into the Forge, make sure to review the Game Guide and FAQ released earlier this week for all the details on how to best care for and build with your HV.",
