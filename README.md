# Grasp Academy

**Project Name:** Grasp Academy

**Project Description:**

Grasp Academy is a Learning Management System (LMS) built on the innovative EDU Chain and powered by Open Campus. The platform integrates EduFi to provide financial support for education, allowing users to learn, earn, and be rewarded for excellence. The Grasp web3 dApp serves as a content platform for creators to share their work and earn directly for their work.

Grasp Academy is designed with a learner-centric approach, prioritizing education and the learning experience above all. It aims to facilitate the onboarding process for users, staff, and community members within tech companies and DAOs, such as the ApeCoin DAO, by offering a structured and rewarding educational experience.

Grasp Academy aims to revolutionize the way users onboard, learn, and earn by leveraging the power of blockchain, EduFi, AI, and tokenized rewards. By prioritizing the educational experience and providing a comprehensive and rewarding learning ecosystem, Grasp Academy will empower learners, tech companies, DAOs, and content creators to achieve their educational goals and foster a culture of continuous learning and excellence.

## Technical Details

The entire Grasp Academy project lives in this repo currently with the Smart Contracts at the root, Foundry has been used for the setup and config of all our Smart contract development for EDU Chain.

The Front-end lives in the pwa folder and is built using vue.js and currently uses web3Auth but this will be switched over to Open Campus ID once it's ready for production usage.

## Getting Started

If this is your first time with Foundry, check out the
[installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.
This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
forge build
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Open Campus:

```sh
forge script script/DeployGraspToken.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url https://rpc.open-campus-codex.gelato.digital --gas-limit 30000000 --with-gas-price 5gwei --skip-simulation
```

```sh
forge script script/DeployGraspNFT.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url https://rpc.open-campus-codex.gelato.digital --gas-limit 30000000 --with-gas-price 5gwei --skip-simulation
```

### Verifying the smart contracts

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
forge verify-contract \
  --rpc-url <https://rpc.open-campus-codex.gelato.digital> \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url '<https://opencampus-codex.blockscout.com/api/>' \
  deployed-contract-address \
  src/GraspToken.sol:GraspToken
```

```sh
forge verify-contract \
  --rpc-url <https://rpc.open-campus-codex.gelato.digital> \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url '<https://opencampus-codex.blockscout.com/api/>' \
  deployed-contract-address \
  src/GraspNFT.sol:GraspNFT
```

forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
forge test --gas-report
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```

This project demonstrates a basic Foundry use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing Foundry

See [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

## Initializing the project

``` bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Testing the contract

``` bash
forge test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can simulate a deployment by running the script:

``` bash
forge script script/Grasp.s.sol
forge script script/GraspNFT.s.sol
```

See [Solidity scripting guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting) for more information.
