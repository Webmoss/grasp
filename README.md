# Grasp Academy

**Project Name:** Grasp Academy

**Project Description:**

Grasp Academy is a Learning Management System (LMS) built on the innovative EDU Chain and powered by Open Campus. The platform integrates EduFi to provide financial support for education, allowing users to learn, earn, and be rewarded for excellence. Additionally, Grasp Academy serves as a content platform for creators to share their work and earn directly from the Grasp web3 platform. Grasp Academy is designed with a learner-centric approach, prioritizing education and the learning experience above all. It aims to facilitate the onboarding process for users, staff, and community members within tech companies and DAOs, such as the ApeCoin DAO, by offering a structured and rewarding educational experience.

Grasp Academy aims to revolutionize the way users onboard, learn, and earn by leveraging the power of blockchain, EduFi, AI, and tokenized rewards. By prioritizing the educational experience and providing a comprehensive and rewarding learning ecosystem, Grasp Academy will empower learners, tech companies, DAOs, and content creators to achieve their educational goals and foster a culture of continuous learning and excellence.

## Technical Details

The entire Grasp Academy project lives in this repo currently with the Smart Contracts at the root, Foundry has been used for the setup and config of all our Smart contract development for EDU Chain.

The Front-end lives in the pwa folder and is built using vue.js and currently uses web3Auth but this will be switched over to Open Campus ID once it's ready for production usage.

A Foundry-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

## What's Inside

- [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/forge): compile, test, fuzz, format, and deploy smart
  contracts
- [Forge Std](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std): collection of helpful contracts and utilities for testing
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): code formatter for non-Solidity files
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): linter for Solidity code

## Getting Started

Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/foundry-template/generate) button at the top of the page to
create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

Or, if you prefer to install the template manually:

```sh
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
forge init --template PaulRBerg/foundry-template
bun install # install Solhint, Prettier, and other Node.js deps
```

If this is your first time with Foundry, check out the
[installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.

## Features

This template builds upon the frameworks and libraries mentioned above, so please consult their respective documentation
for details about their specific features.

For example, if you're interested in exploring Foundry in more detail, you should look at the
[Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). In particular, you may be interested in reading the
[Writing Tests](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests.html) tutorial.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with a set of sensible default configurations for you to use. These defaults can be found in the
following files:

```text
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solhint.json
├── foundry.toml
└── remappings.txt
```

### VSCode Integration

This template is IDE agnostic, but for the best user experience, you may want to use it in VSCode alongside Nomic
Foundation's [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

For guidance on how to integrate a Foundry project in VSCode, please refer to this
[guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/vscode).

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Installing Dependencies

Foundry typically uses git submodules to manage dependencies, but this template uses Node.js packages because
[submodules don't scale](https://twitter.com/PaulRBerg/status/1736695487057531328).

This is how to install dependencies:

1. Install the dependency using your preferred package manager, e.g. `bun install dependency-name`
   - Use this syntax to install from GitHub: `bun install github:username/repo-name`
2. Add a remapping for the dependency in [remappings.txt](./remappings.txt), e.g.
   `dependency-name=node_modules/dependency-name`

Note that OpenZeppelin Contracts is pre-installed, so you can follow that as an example.

## Writing Tests

To write a new test contract, you start by importing `Test` from `forge-std`, and then you inherit it in your test
contract. Forge Std comes with a pre-instantiated [cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/) environment
accessible via the `vm` property. If you would like to view the logs in the terminal output, you can add the `-vvv` flag
and use [console.log](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq?highlight=console.log#how-do-i-use-consolelog).

This template comes with an example test contract [Foo.t.sol](./test/Foo.t.sol)

## Usage

This is a list of the most frequently needed commands.

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
forge build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
forge clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
forge build
```

### Coverage

Get a test coverage report:

```sh
forge coverage
```

### Deploy

Deploy to Anvil:

```sh
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --fork-url http://localhost:8545
```

For this script to work, you need to have a `MNEMONIC` environment variable set to a valid
[BIP39 mnemonic](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

For instructions on how to deploy to a testnet or mainnet, check out the
[Solidity Scripting](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting.html) tutorial.

### Format

Format the contracts:

```sh
forge fmt
```

### Gas Usage

Get a gas report:

```sh
forge test --gas-report
```

### Lint

Lint the contracts:

```sh
bun run lint
```

### Test

Run the tests:

```sh
forge test
```

Generate test coverage and output result to the terminal:

```sh
bun run test:coverage
```

Generate test coverage with lcov report (you'll have to open the `./coverage/index.html` file in your browser, to do so
simply copy paste the path):

```sh
bun run test:coverage:report
```
